# SimpleTicket Style Guide

<a href="https://hackerbeats.github.io/SimpleTicket-Style-Guide/">SimpleTicket Style Guide</a> is a project I completed as part of the <a href="https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/">Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Path</a> course.

The task for this project was simple and open-ended: build your own basic design system for a website. The project also included a few specific requirements such as sections on color, font and text styles.

To help make this project feel like more of a real world task, I decided to spin up a fictitious product and brand called SimpleTicket to build a style guide around. I pulled the idea for SimpleTicket from my Dev > Project Ideas folder in Notion.

I got the idea for SimpleTicket from my current full-time job, where we are in the midst of implementing a new full-scale ERP system. Given the numerous bugs that have been popping up with the new system, the ERP team created an internal ticketing tool built on Notion to help employees submit bugs and issues.
