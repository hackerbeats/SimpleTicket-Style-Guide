# SimpleTicket Style Guide

## Overview
<a href="https://hackerbeats.github.io/SimpleTicket-Style-Guide/">SimpleTicket Style Guide</a> is a project I completed as part of the <a href="https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/">Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Path</a> course.

The task for this project was simple and open-ended: build your own basic design system for a website. The project also included a few specific requirements such as sections on color, font and text styles.

To help make this project feel like more of a real world task, I decided to spin up a fictitious product and brand called SimpleTicket to build a style guide around. I pulled the idea for SimpleTicket from my Dev / Project Ideas folder in Notion.

I got the idea for SimpleTicket from my current full-time job, where we are in the midst of implementing a new full-scale ERP system. Given the numerous bugs that have been popping up with the new system, the ERP team created an internal ticketing tool built on Notion to help employees submit bugs and issues. The tool works pretty well, but has a few shortcomings. I felt it would be cool to create a super simple ticketing tool with a clean, minimalist UI to help serve this purpose.

## Execution
My goal was to create a professional looking style guide with the feel of a real brand, but utilize tools and resources to expedite the process so I don't spend too much time on the project.

My first step was to create the SimpleTicket logo. I decided to utilize <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL•E 2<a> to assist with this effort.
  
On my fifth prompt to DALL•E, I landed on some good results and found my logo mark of choice: a distraught-looking helpdesk agent.

This DALL•E generated icon image spoke to me. We've all been there before, tethered to the support line and at the whims of disgruntled customers. 

I then imported the DALL•E .png icon file into Adobe Illustrator and performed Image Trace to vectorize the image for further editing.

I removed the neck and shoulders portion of the icon, cleaned up some of the vector lines with the Smooth tool, added the SimpleTicket text in Avenir font, and the logo was finished. The full process from start to finish took around 30 minutes.
